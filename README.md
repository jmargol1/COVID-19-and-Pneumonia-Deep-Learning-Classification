# COVID-19-and-Pneumonia-Deep-Learning-Classification
Deep Learning final project applying deep learning image recognition methods to classify COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Healthy lungs

### File Structure
- DL_Final.ipynb --> Preprocessing, and model building source code
- 

### Running the Source Code
- Download and open the file DL_Final.ipynb in google colab or follow this link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z6X-NNcO1M8ETKlUf540bF3ZMxBZ2IzS?usp=sharing
- To run you must retireve a kaggle.json file from kaggle
  - Sign in to kaggle and access your user profile
  - Access Settings --> Generate new API token --> Generate. This should save a file to your downloads called "kaggle.json"
  - If the file does not download automatically, copy and save your API key in a file titled "kaggle.json"
- Recommend using GPU runtime for faster performance
- Click run all and in the first cell when prompted to upload files, upload "kaggle.json" file
- Accept mounting to drive when prompted later, the rest will run sequentially
